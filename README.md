## Alpha Advantage Challenge

Built with react and mantine.

- `pnpm dev` to start the dev server and run it locally.
- https://douglasg14b.github.io/alphaadvantage-challenge/ to see it live
    - Note: Browser routing is janky here, reloding in a child route will 404
- Due to the 25 requests/day limit, this caches heavily, and has fallback static cache for some data baked in.
    - Details for `NVDA`, `SGN` and `ASST` exist
    - To reset API limits, change your IP and refresh, it will load from cache first
